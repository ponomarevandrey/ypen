# How to use

```pug
blockquote(class='blockquote text text_size_xl blockquote_theme_default')
  p(class='blockquote__body') Big type, even huge type, can be beautiful and useful. But poise is usually far more important than size – and poise consists primarily of emptiness. Typographically, poise is made of white&space.
